*You are just a data point.*

Data, more data and even more data. You hear that data is the new oil. You hear about data privacy, data leak and a hundred other words suffixed to data. But when you work with data for a living, you start getting an insider peek into this world. You see the internals of why the hype exists and in my nascent stages of working in this industry, I can safely conclude that It truly is worth the hype.

However there are other pressing concerns here that don't get enough attention. We speculate (in fear?) that robots with human or super human level intelligence will dominate us in the future. That's looks far from possible in the current landscape. But, what looks more likely is that we will be dominated by emotionless, automated systems designed by humans who are racing to maximize their single-minded goals of profitability or efficiency. Whether this is right or wrong is another debate altogether. But it is starting to grow strong in existence and will soon be ubiquitous. 

You think you are talking to a customer representative but you are actually a data feeding machine to a chatbot. You are just another row in an excel file. The chatbot is just another data source for a huge database that has all your previous interactions with the stakeholder. All these raw details are then sent into an algorithm that [even the creators most often have no clue why it works the way it works](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/11/11/apple-card-algorithm-sparks-gender-bias-allegations-against-goldman-sachs/). What the algorithm then spits out, well, that is your fate. You entered in the chatbot that you got a pay raise so you can pay your loans now. The algorithm decides to step up your credit limit and give you more offers. But, Joe on the other hand, morosely typed into the chatbot that he just got laid-off and the demi-god at the other end just pulled the plug on poor Joe's loan and his image in the algorithm's mind is now tarnished for ages to come.
 
There's no emotion in the pipeline anywhere. They say the internet will soon remove all the middlemen in businesses. With it, we might just remove all the human emotion as well. That is, if there is still any left. Is this the only way to achieve efficiency at scale? Is it end of subjectivity and with it, human emotion? Time will tell.
