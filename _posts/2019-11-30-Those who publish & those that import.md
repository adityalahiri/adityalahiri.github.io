Usually, in every discipline there exist multiple schools of thought. More often than not, there are two broad divisions. Both of them are
equally valuable and pivotal in the grand scheme of things. However, sometimes one starts gaining a lot of traction and is associated with more intellectual
prowess than the other. [Take the hard sciences versus the soft sciences situation.](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/la-xpm-2013-jun-19-la-oe-cuno-humanities-funding-20130620-story.html)
STEM graduates get paid obscene
amounts of money while their social sciences' counterparts aren't appreciated half as much. Then someday the engineers mess up and say, well
what can we do, we just ran the numbers. And that's when organizations fall and the regulatory bodies step in saying " Hey, thats not ethical".
Maybe you should have hired the people who were studying ethics and humanities full time to guide you before all this. Sigh.

In the field of Machine Learning, there's also a binary split. The researchers and the practictioners. Having tried my hands at both, as an
amateur, I can see a clear demarcation between the two. Researchers take pride in the fact that they are the ones who are actually
coming up with the world changing algorithms of today. That it is their keen optimizations of systems that is making the world tick.
They want to be a part of something that is more intellectualy simulating and novel than using pre-built systems. 
However, the naive ones do highly derivative work. Mostly, they just add little things that aren't even reproducible to get that
next publication out so that they can drive their numbers up. The good ones spend days, months or even years coming up with something
so novel and robust that it changes the direction of the field for decades to come.

On the other hand, there are practitioners. They take the latest from researchers and translate it into something valuable.
The naive ones simply use pre-built packages like black boxes and get quick results. They
are unable to get back on their feet if the pre-built system does not work accordingly. The good ones know whats inside. They know how the
internals work. This allows them to weave together and merge multiple off the shelf techniques to create something unique and beneficial
to their use case. And they know how to deal with the system, if any part goes south. The challenge here is more of creativity than novelty.
The good practictioner needs to have the breadth of the knowledge of tools and sufficient depth of each of them to be able to use them efficiently.
More than that, he needs to have an appetite to always learn more about different fields so that he can create the final product.

I have seen, met and talked to people who lie in the "holier than thou" spectrum in both fields. People who think researchers are the
only driving force behind the field and that people who use different algorithms to create a product of value aren't doing a work thats 
challenging enough. There are also those who think that they have had enough research done in the field for now and that the real value
lies in churning out the value from existing methods and do the best that one can from them until its saturated. But we should probably strive to not fall in either
of the two brackets. I feel that the good work done in both areas is absolutely necessary for the field to thrive.Both of them strive together and the only way that the
field will progress is if both respect and learn from one another. On the other hand, there are "not so good" members in both brackets. It
would be much better if we do not gauge the factions on their basis but rather on the basis of those who do things the right way. This will
allow the field to prosper using the best of both worlds and will avoid one section from inevitably dominating the other, leading to an eventual
downfall of the very field they are trying to improve.
