# What does the Citizenship Amendement Bill state? 
It amended the Citizenship Act of 1955 by providing a path to Indian citizenship for Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian religious minorities from the neighboring Muslim majority countries of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

# The basic reason for conflict?
For a country that prides itself as the world's largest secular nation, this is the first time religion has been used as a criterion for citizenship under Indian law.

# What is the Government's rationale?
India is kind enough to help the "minorities" of its neighbouring nations and wants to welcome them to prevent them from facing religious persecution in their own nations. 
According to the government, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh are "Muslim-majority countries" where Islam has been declared as the official state religion through constitutional amendments in recent decades, and therefore Muslims in these Islamic countries are "unlikely to face religious persecution" and cannot be "treated as persecuted minorities". Hence, they are not welcome. 

# Why are people in Assam and the North East protesting?

### Enter -> NRC
NRC is the National Register of Citizens. The NRC identified illegal immigrants from Assam on the Supreme Court's order. This has been a state-specific exercise to keep its ethnic uniqueness unaltered. But ever since its implementation, there has been a growing demand for its nationwide implementation and it will most likely be applied to all of India soon. It effectively suggests to bring in a legislation that will enable the government to identify infiltrators who have been living in India illegally, detain them and deport them to where they came from

### Do people of Assam support NRC?

In a way, yes. Except in Bengali speakersâ€™ dominated Barak valley, people in other parts fear CAB will lead to lakhs of Hindus from Bangladesh swamping indigenous communities, burdening resources and threatening their language, culture and tradition. 

### Do people of Assam support CAB?

No! CAB has a 2014 cut-off date but protesters say Assam bore the brunt of immigrants from 1951 to 1971, while other states did not, and it is unfair to impose more on the state. Protesters say they do not trust the Centre and CAB will undo the Assam Accord.The National Registry of Citizens was a promise made in the Assam Accord to identify and deport foreigners. By the time it was published, it became evident that majority of those denied citizenship were Hindus or indigenous tribes. Protesters say CAB will make NRC redundant and bestow citizenship on illegal immigrants

# Why is rest of India protesting?

For religious equality. To prevent discriminatory treatment based on religion against the Muslims of the nation.
