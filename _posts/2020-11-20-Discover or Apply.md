*To discover new techniques or to apply existing ones*

The end goal is to build. Now, one may build algorithms by the process of discovery. Or one may apply exisiting knowledge to create a product. Both are
challenging. Both require persistence and creativity. And both are useless in isolation. For instance, discovering something that no one
applies to anything beneficial is not a desirable outcome. Likewise, one cannot apply something to create something of value if it does not exist in the first place.

This question of whether I like discovering more or applying more keeps coming back to me. Here's how I think about them. Although discovering something has
a necessity behind it, yet it is a far more flexible and independent process. And that is both the positive and challenging part of it - Freedom. Whereas,
applying has more concrete outcomes, often a quantifiable metric in term of $$ or time. This nature makes it more exciting and also constraints the process to 
a greater extent.

Some people do both. They take time to discover something useful and then apply it to solve real issues that either a.) makes the world a "better place" or  b.)
makes them rich. Some discover for pleasure and allow other people to apply them however they want. And some pick up what has been discovered and ingeniously
apply it to solve a use-case.

The world needs all three. I am figuring out what I need "more".
