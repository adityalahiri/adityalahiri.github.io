Covid '19 implies Stay At Home which in turn implies LOTS of time to read LOTS of books. Here's a diverse reading list for the summer of 2020.

# Trillion Dollar Coach

Bill Campbell was a Silicon Valley "Guru". He was the CEO of companies like Intuit and was a Coach to folks at companies like Google And Apple.
The book hihglights the way he approached problems, handled egos and essentially coached these trillion dollar empires. A former football coach, he
made teams work at workplaces. Lots to learn from this book on how to apply oneself whether you are in a growing startup or a big established organisation.
I wish I had found this a year earlier. But never too late for a book like this. Definitely do read this up if you are going to start a new job!

# Into Thin Air

I went for a trek in 2016. I get flashes of it while reading this book. The book describes a tragic Everest attempt. If you have ever been to a mountain, you'll love this. 
If you have not, you will still love this and go for one later when the world reopens. 
Written by the author of the famous "Into The Wild", this is the author's account of events
that took place during an Everest attempt. It is riveting, engaging and you will not want to put it down once you pick it up. And you'll be googling the
names of the folks in the book out of curiosity too!

# When Breath Becomes Air

A memoir. My first. In times like these, it will put the perspective of mortality back into your heads. But in a beautiful and raw way. The life of
Paul Kalinithi, a Stanford neurosurgeon, who at the peak of his career gets diagnosed with Stage IV Lung cancer. He describes how he dealt with this news.
How his marriage dealt with it. How he as a doctor himself dealt with it. You will end up appreciating the work of doctors even more after this book. And
you will realise that whatever plans we make for X years down the road, can get crushed in an instant and despite that, we can make good of our time. Once 
you get past the intial 20-30% of this book, you will want to finish it in one sitting.

# The Courage To Be Disliked

A book written as a dialogue between a philosopher and a youth. The philosopher practices Adlreian physcology. The main tenet being that you are in control
of how you react to a situtation and all human problems are interpersonal problems. 
It is hilarious at times because the youth reacts and asks questions that you might in real life. It is a self help book like no
other. It backs up what it preaches using well fleshed out arguments. And the dialogue form of writing is a first for me and is what makes it a must read!

# Man's Search For Meaning

I did not know this book was about hope. A holocaust survivor writes his experience, what he learnt and what he observed. He infuses hope in you despite the
harshest of circumstances. One for the pandemic times, definitely. The famous line, "He who has a why can bear almost any how" will give you goosebumps when it
comes up. If you are feeling not so good lately, do go over this. It is not a long read. You will definitely feel much more optmistic once you are through this book.
