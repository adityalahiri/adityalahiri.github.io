Why being in tech comes from a position of privilege, and how we should collectively be inclusive despite it.

Ever heard of the White Man's privilege? This is what Wikipedia has to say about it-

White privilege (or white skin privilege) is the societal privilege that benefits white people over non-white people in some societies, particularly if they are otherwise under the same social, political, or economic circumstances.

Let's get back to India. We do not have white men. We have well-to-do upper class Hindus males. The definition is exactly the same. No tweaks needed.
Now, privilege here is not owning a yacht or going off to resorts every weekend for a getaway. Privilege in this context is in terms of the extreme basics-

1. Do you not end up being killed when you are born?
2. Do you have a guarantee to complete your basic education (Financial situations permitting)?
3. Do you fit in the environment of your job without being a sore thumb? Are you one of "them"?
4. Do you feel safe at your home and do you not think twice before going out for a walk at midnight?

If you are not in the group mentioned in the beginning, you might not check all the boxes. And that's where privilege comes in. To have the gift of not even thinking
about these kinds of things and being able to focus on what is important to you.
The point is to not make anyone who belongs to this group guilt over being a part of it. It is just to remind ourselves that we are lucky. That's all we are. We ended up at the right environment and
at the right time. The point is that we understand this and remember that we *just* got lucky. We did nothing to earn it. Therefore, we need to be empathatic towards
those that did not end up hitting the lottery. Women, for example.

I was a part of a private college in India. Most people there were well off financially. Women included. 

There was a common entrance criteria for all. So everyone
who ended up being there had a combination of financial privilege + hard work(or brains). Women included.
 
This led people to believe that when organisations come
over to the beach to take them up for jobs, they should treat everyone the same. Right? Because everyone came in with the same credentials and worked equally hard.


Wrong. The women who made it thus far were fortunate enough to tick the first two boxes. (not being killed at birth, and being able to pursue education). But, 
inclusion does not end there. If we end up going to an organisation where we have everyone who is similar to us, all the hard work that had been done up until now 
would end up wasted. Women joining the organisation would find it difficult to look up to anyone like them who had been there before and made progress. They will
face incredible resistance to see a future for themselves in this organisation when they find nobody that has taken this path before. Then before you know it, the 
self confidence will take a hit and that's the end of that. This is why big organisations take initiatives to get women in their workforce. And they do it not out
of charity but because they know that they add value. That a different perspective matters. Because, believe it or not, women and minorites form a major part 
of their consumer base. However, similar to the scenario wherein getting into a college based on ticking a couple of boxes did not mark the end, just providing
and entry point into a male dominated industry does not mark completion. There's still more to do. However, currently at my stage in my career I have only seen
the nitty gritties up to this point so I am in no position to comment on how things work after this. Maybe, in a decade or so.

Long story short -- Just because we hit the lottery, we should not feel entitled to *equality* when the lottery itself shot us way over equality. Think a little
bit when you complain about big tech giving special opportunities to women and why they would be doing it. Maybe, its because it is good for the companies and
everyone included. Maybe, different perspectives matter. Maybe, they aren't stealing your opportunites and instead getting what's rightfully theirs. Just think.
 
 
 **Context--Thoughts muddled up after working for a year in an inclusive organisation, seeing juniors rumble about big tech *handing*
 out opportunites to their peers of the opposite gender, white-black inequality in the US, Hindu-Muslim polarisation in India, polarisation in general and need for more
 perspective.
