A daily log of little things I learn pertaining to Computer Science and AI/ML.
(Inspired by [Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/))

* Went through [Stanford's Karel Bot](https://compedu.stanford.edu/karel-reader/docs/python/en/chapter1.html)which used to teach Intro to programming at Stanford. So neat!

## 10/4/20

* If stuck between too many little fixes, just start all over again! Far more efficient.
* Discovered Google's [diff_match_patch](https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch) to find diff, match and patch (:P) text.
* Appreciating the need to write quality generalised tests for modules! Avoid hard coding as much as you can.

## 9/4/20

* To get to end of line in VI, command mode then $
* PDFs can be opened in Jupyter Lab!
* Discovered [this](https://explosion.ai/demos/displacy) cool application of what we learned in Compilers course !
