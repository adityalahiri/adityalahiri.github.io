A daily log of little things I learn pertaining to Computer Science and AI/ML.
(Inspired by [Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/))

## 21/4/20

* [Setup remote local sftp on Sublime](https://medium.com/@daniwhkim/remote-ftp-sftp-with-sublime-de7d71a2b400). Life gets simpler!
* Wrote the first functional test of my life. Hard work!


## 20/4/20

* Symlinks! Used Symlink in [Jupyter](https://cyberhelp.sesync.org/faq/how-to-create-a-symlink-to-research-directory-in-Jupyter-lab.html) to get another folder in sidebar to access files on server. So, neat!
* Learnt why people simply do not use one hot econding instead of embeddings in text models -> High dimensionality!

## 19/4/20

* Discovered [LALE](https://github.com/IBM/lale) library by IBM for semi automated Data Science workflow.
* Read Chapter 1 of the [Causal Reasoning Book](https://causalinference.gitlab.io/causal-reasoning-book-chapter1/). Coming to this after reading The Book Of Why and wanting a more machine learning oriented resource. Aim to use Causal Reasoning as aid to Machine Learning Interpretability.

## 18/4/20

* N/A

## 17/4/20

* Used Multioutput classification for the first time

## 16/4/20

* Used tf-idf irl for first time.
* Read about [dataset shift](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/07/covariate-shift-the-hidden-problem-of-real-world-data-science/)

## 15/4/20

N/A

## 14/4/20

* Realized that I should brush up on SQL and not resort to doing everything via pandas.
* Found this new pandas function to stack columns down. [pd.stack](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.stack.html)

## 13/4/20

* Ctrl+Shift+P and then clear cell output to clear the output of a current Jupyter cell
* Found this [spelling correction library](https://github.com/wolfgarbe/SymSpell)

## 12/4/20

* Read this [new paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11097) that highlights the problems in using Shapely values for feature attribution.
* Got mind blown by Microsoft's Power Point's [enhanced design recommendations](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2019/06/18/powerpoint-ai-upgrade-designer-major-milestone-1-billion-slides/)!

## 11/4/20

* Went through [Stanford's Karel Bot](https://compedu.stanford.edu/karel-reader/docs/python/en/chapter1.html)which used to teach Intro to programming at Stanford. So neat!

## 10/4/20

* If stuck between too many little fixes, just start all over again! Far more efficient.
* Discovered Google's [diff_match_patch](https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch) to find diff, match and patch (:P) text.
* Appreciating the need to write quality generalised tests for modules! Avoid hard coding as much as you can.

## 9/4/20

* To get to end of line in VI, command mode then $
* PDFs can be opened in Jupyter Lab!
* Discovered [this](https://explosion.ai/demos/displacy) cool application of what we learned in Compilers course !
