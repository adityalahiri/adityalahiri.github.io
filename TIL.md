A daily log of little things I learn pertaining to Computer Science and AI/ML.
(Inspired by [Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/))

## 14/4/20

* Realized that I should brush up on SQL and not resort to doing everything via pandas.
* Found this new pandas function to stack columns down. [pd.stack](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.stack.html)

## 13/4/20

* Ctrl+Shift+P and then clear cell output to clear the output of a current Jupyter cell
* Found this [spelling correction library](https://github.com/wolfgarbe/SymSpell)

## 12/4/20

* Read this [new paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11097) that highlights the problems in using Shapely values for feature attribution.
* Got mind blown by Microsoft's Power Point's [enhanced design recommendations](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2019/06/18/powerpoint-ai-upgrade-designer-major-milestone-1-billion-slides/)!

## 11/4/20

* Went through [Stanford's Karel Bot](https://compedu.stanford.edu/karel-reader/docs/python/en/chapter1.html)which used to teach Intro to programming at Stanford. So neat!

## 10/4/20

* If stuck between too many little fixes, just start all over again! Far more efficient.
* Discovered Google's [diff_match_patch](https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch) to find diff, match and patch (:P) text.
* Appreciating the need to write quality generalised tests for modules! Avoid hard coding as much as you can.

## 9/4/20

* To get to end of line in VI, command mode then $
* PDFs can be opened in Jupyter Lab!
* Discovered [this](https://explosion.ai/demos/displacy) cool application of what we learned in Compilers course !
