<h1>Hello!</h1>

Thank you for visiting my home page on the internet! My name is Aditya Lahiri and I currently work as a Research Engineer at American Express,AI Labs.
I am a Computer Science undergrad from BITS Pilani, Goa. I work in the area of model explainability and ensemble algorithms in specific and machine learning
and data science in general.

<h1> More about me </h1>
There are a few tabs on the top of this page. Let's see how you can use those to know more about me.
I like to learn a bit everyday. You can look at what I learned in the TIL section. I read books. They keep me sane. You can find my reading list up top. And I like to write.
My blog posts are a peek into that. I also post summaries of papers I find interesting. Those can be viewed from the PaW section.

Thanks for dropping by! I would love to connect with you if you want to too. You can setup a time using the contact tab if you'd like to. Stay safe & take care!
