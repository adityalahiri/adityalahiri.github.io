I am driven by the idea of solving problems through data and code. To this end, I have worked with multiple organizations like SocialCops, TCS Research, and American Express in order to solve a diverse range of problems including research and development. I am a Computer Science undergraduate from BITS Pilani, Goa and will complete my bachelor's in December 2019. 

I love to read, blog, run, lift weights and am new to swimming and boxing. Always in for a cold one or a strong espresso.
