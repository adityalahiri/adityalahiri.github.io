Hi!

My name is Aditya Lahiri and I am a 21 year old who is working his way through life. I completed my undergraduate in Computer Science from BITS Pilani, Goa in December, 2019. Here's me on the farewell day :smiley:

During my time at BITS, I got started with Machine Learning and Data Science. What began out of curiousity at the end of my first semester, now continues to be a source of excitement, and livelihood for me. I worked with some super cool proffessors on a few intriguing projects during college. These included predicting whether a DNA and protein chain would interact or not, and learning geometric symbols from just one image! 

In the summer of 2019, I interned at a startup called Atlan as a Data Scientist. I learnt more that summer than I'd learn in a year. The place was insanely fast paced, motivated and challenging. I built a couple of cool things during my time there.

After that, I headed over to American Express, AI Labs for a Six Month internship. I was a Research Engineering intern in the Machine Learning and Optimization group. My work involved research and development. I also learnt about the workings of Multi National Organisations and the different challenges that work on such a scale presents.

Besides all this, I have had a few big moments in my life. 

One was when I invited the co-founder of Stack Overflow, Mr. Joel Spolsky to my college tech fest Quark, in my freshman year. It was surreal to host and meet him and ask him my questions personally.

The other was when my talk on Machine Learning for imbalanced datasets got accepted at PyData New York City in November of 2019. I made my first trip outside India to attend and speak at PyData. It was the experience of a lifetime for me.
