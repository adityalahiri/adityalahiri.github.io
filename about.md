### Hi!

My name is Aditya Lahiri and I am a 21 year old who is working his way through life. I completed my undergraduate in Computer Science from BITS Pilani, Goa in Decemeber, 2019. Here's me on the farewell day :smiley:

During my time at BITS, I got started with Machine Learning and Data Science. What began out of curiousity at the end of my first semester, now continues to be a source of excitement, and livelihood for me. I worked with some super cool proffessors on a few intriguing projects during college. These included predicting whether a DNA and protein chain would interact or not, and learning geometric symbols from just one image! 

In the summer of 2019, I interned at a startup called Atlan as a Data Scientist. I learnt more that summer than I'd learn in a year. The place was insanely fast paced, motivated and challenging. I built a couple of cool things during my time there. 

After that, I headed over to American Express, AI Labs for a Six Month internship. I was a Research Engineering intern in the Machine Learning and Optimization group. My work involved research and development. I also learnt about the workings of Multi National Organisations and the different challenges that work on such a scale presents.
